    comment: We feel so lucky to have found SitDoggie when we got our puppy last year! She is reliable, more than accommodating and our dog absolutely loves her! You can tell she genuinely cares and loves what she does. Knowing our boy is well taken care of each day when we are working makes us happy. We highly recommend her!!

    comment: SitDoggie is our oncall dog walker and she is great! She's always available and responds in a timely and friendly manner. Our dog loves her and she is great about sending a follow-up email after every visit to let us know how the walk went. Her online payment/appointment request system is convenient also. We definitely feel we can trust her in our home and with our pet!
